Contributing Code
-----------------
This is my (Kira's) fork of Amnesia: TDD. I'm not sure what I will do with it, but most likely I will try to fix and add new stuff to the engine. Yes, I know the Chad Gang is already working on something similar, and I'd highly encourage you to check their work out instead of this, since they're much more skilled than me! This is just a way for me to mess around and have fun. Maybe this will be abandoned really soon, or never get past 1 commit, who knows? I don't!
